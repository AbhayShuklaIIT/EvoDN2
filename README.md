* Aim to develop a novel algorithm that can solve a large-scale Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP)
* Problem is formulated as a bi-objective function to minimize the cost of the tour and reduce model complexity
* Developed a self-evolving neural network along with genetic operators like crossover and mutation
